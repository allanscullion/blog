For anyone even remotely interested, I have uploaded a GIT repository of useful PowerShell scripts to handle common Active Directory tasks. You can find it [here][powershellad].

Scripting a method to easily remove or add a user from a list of Domain groups was the driver. Feel free to fork it and add your own stuff.
