I have decided to import my old political rants from **Politicalog** into this site. You can find the potted history of the reasons behind my amateur ramblings [here](http://politicalog.ascullion.com/).

The main archive can be found [here](http://politicalog.ascullion.com/).

My reasons?:

*   Posterity (mainly)
*   I wanted to preserve the full archive (including all the comments)
*   I want to remind everyone exactly why New Labour was such a disaster for this country
*   I have a feeling they might be back soon... If that happens, I'll start that blog up again as quick as you can blink
