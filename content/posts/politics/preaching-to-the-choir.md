I can hear an [entire nation of Scots][idiot] screaming "Duhhh!!":

> In an attempt to distance his party from the Tories, the Deputy Prime
> Minister will say: “People in Scotland know that the Conservatives
> cannot be trusted to deliver a fairer society. Not on their own
> anyway.
>
> “With only one MP in Scotland, who honestly thinks that the
> Conservatives on their own will stand up for you?”
